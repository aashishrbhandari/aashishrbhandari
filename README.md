hi, i'm [Ashish R Bhandari](https://aashishrbhandari.github.io/) this side, I am a Security Engineer... and before being a Security Engineer, i am an Engineer (but not by degree), but by the way i want to understand problems, learn about softwares, solutions and explore how they work. i always want to deep dive and understand about the software that i am using as to how it was created, what it could do and what was used to built it and then try to figure out the area as to where it might not work.

I invest my time to understand solutions and have a deep love for Security Solutions. I am core tech guy who has explored and is exploring all IT Spaces: Development, Testing, IT Operations, Cloud, Security, System Engineering, Pentesting, SOC etc and still alot to learn and explore.
