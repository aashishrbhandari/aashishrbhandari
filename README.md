hi, i'm [Ashish R Bhandari](https://aashishrbhandari.github.io/) this side, I am a Security Engineer... and before being a Security Engineer, i am an Engineer (but not by degree), but by the way i want to understand problems, learn about softwares, solutions and explore how they work. i always want to deep dive and understand about the software that i am using as, to how it was created, how it works, what it could do and what was used to built it and then try to figure out the area, as to where it might not work (simple example: a firewall without DPI cannot block https url strings).

I love to debug, test, develop, deploy & hunt for software, network & security solutions. my journey comprises doing dev, system engineering, security solution sme, security solution tester, offensive testing, firewall implementation, network security, and threat hunting and i loved them all.

I invest my time to understand solutions and have a deep love for Security Solutions. I am a core tech guy who has explored and is exploring all IT Spaces: Development, Testing(software testing & security), IT Operations, Cloud, Security, System Engineering, Pentesting, SOC etc and still alot to learn and explore.

I love solutions that have core tech: like proxy, firewall, waf (which involves networking, filtering & control, debugging & troubleshooting); python, bash (write code to solve or debug a problem); sase/sse tester (understand what a solution provides and validate it, check what all features a solution provide and what it does not and recommend.)


## ➼ Who I am....
- A Security Engineer with Knowledge of Offensive as well as Defensive Side
- A SASE/SSE Solution Lover & Tester
- A Debugger & Troubleshooter of Software, Solution, Cloud, Network & Infrastructure
- Networking & Security Solutions Explorer
- CLI Lover (therefore indirectly Linux Lover)
- A ok-ok developer. meaning i can understand and sometimes also develop
- Helper by Nature (I try to always put my frontfoot ahead whenever i feel i can solve someone's problem.)
